                <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                <p>We are a team of highly skilled goat liasons who have a passion for helping others. We offer our goats for lawn cleaning service to offer an alternative to those who care about the environment. Our mission is simple: "Let us help you keep your lawn clean and the environment clean at the same." </p>
                
                <h2>Where do we get our goats?</h2>
                <p>In 1993, John Miller passed away.  He owned a goat farm and this farm was passed down to his grand daughter, Sarah.  Sarah sought fit to use the goat farm to help save the enviroment by training and using these goats to offer the services listed on this page. John originally rescued these goats from a cruel audio recording farm in Nepal.  They would force the goats to wear microphones and then record the noises they made for use on the internet.  These recordings would be placed into youtube vidoes, audio clips, and other formats for people to laugh at. When John first heard of this, he knew he had to do something about it.  John bought all the goats and shipped them to his farm just outside of Boston where they still live today.</p>
                
                <h2>Who handles the goats?</h2>
                <p>Sarah and her team of highly skilled goat liasons handle the goats in day to day operations.  The goats are transported, massaged, fed, read bed time stories to, and trained all under the supervision of our liasons.  Our team of liasons consists 5 people, including Sarah.  </p>
